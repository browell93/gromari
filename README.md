# predicto

A Python Django app that scrapes stock data for the Toronto Stock Exchange and places it in an postgresql database, then uses that data to build a machine learning system to predict stock patterns for trading.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
